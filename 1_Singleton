Singleton is to ensure that a class will only have one object
for example, we always expect there is only one connection to a database from a certain application
Also, in the game development, only one game control is needed to start the whole game, in which case the game control can be implemented by singletoni

The Singleton can be implemented by setting the constructor private and setting the Instance static.
static Singleton* Instance() : declare the object
static VOID Destroy() : free object
